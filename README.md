Meteor ngCordova
======

The purpose of this [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) package is to add [ngCordova](ngcordova.com) to an [Angular-Meteor](http://www.angular-meteor.com/) project. 

*Current ngCordova version included:* v0.1.23-alpha.

Note: The other way to add ngCordova to Meteor is via Bower, supported by another Atmosphere package but that way is discouraged because it has negative side effects on the Angular-Meteor project.
